==============

This repo contains Matlab code to calculate energy efficient receptive fields to encode a dataset of images.

Full details are [here](http://www.inferencelab.com/energy-efficient-receptive-field-code/)

This is my first Git repo so I am experimenting, and more info will appear at some point.
